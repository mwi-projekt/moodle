Feature: Dataform max entries

    @javascript
    Scenario: Students cannot add more than max entries
        Given I start afresh with dataform "Max Entries test"
        And I log in as "teacher1"
        And I am on "Course 1" course homepage

        When I follow "Max Entries test"
        And I navigate to "Edit settings" in current page administration
        And I expand all fieldsets
        And I set the field "Maximum entries" to "1"
        And I press "Save and display"
        Then I see "This dataform appears to be new or with incomplete setup"

        # Add a text field
        When I go to manage dataform "fields"
        And I add a dataform field "text" with "Field 01"
        Then I see "Field 01"

        # Add a view with with default submission buttons
        When I follow "Views"
        And I set the field "Add a view" to "grid"
        And I set the field "Name" to "View 01"
        And I press "Save changes"

        Then I see "View 01"
        And I see "Default view is not set."
        When I set "View 01" as default view
        Then I do not see "Default view is not set."

        # Teacher can submit more than max
